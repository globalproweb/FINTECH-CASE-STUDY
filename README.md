* Core metrics that companies in this domain use: 

  * 	Pull Through Rate: This KPI measures pipeline efficiency by dividing total funded loans by the number of applications submitted during a defined period.

  * Decision to Close Time Cycle: The decision to close time cycle provides information about the number of days required to close and fund a loan after the underwriting decision has been made

  *	Abandoned Loan Rate: Abandoned loan rate measures the percentage of loan applications that are abandoned by 	a borrower after they have been approved by the lender

  * Average Origination Value: The average origination value measures the total revenue earned for each loan over a given time.

  * Application Approval Rate: This metric is calculated by dividing the amount of approved applications by the amount 	of submitted applications

  * Net Charge-Off Rate: The net charge-off rate is the difference between gross charge-offs and any 	subsequent recoveries of delinquent debt

  * Customer Acquisition Cost; This key financial measurement is the ratio of a borrower’s lifetime value to a borrower’s 	acquisition cost. (6)

  1.  Zidisha, Zidisha is the first direct person-to-person microlending service that focuses on entrepreneurs and job creation. Its name” comes from the Swahili word meaning “grow.” Unlike Kiva, Zidisha does not loan through financial institutions but facilitates direct lending between people (4)
  
  2. Building Resources Across Communities: Building Resources Across Communities (BRAC) is the largest non-governmental development organization in the world in terms of number of employees. Hasan founded BRAC in 1972 and it employs more than 120,000 people in 11 countries. BRAC has a microfinance program, primarily in Bangladesh, which has loaned to 5.6 million borrowers, 87 percent of whom are women. Unlike Kiva and Zidisha, which operate person-to-person lending services, BRAC distributes loans to lenders on its own using donations and other funds. BRAC also does work unrelated to microfinance, investing in schools and in water, hygiene and sanitation services. (4)

     
  3. Women’s Microfinance Initiative (WMI): Women’s Microfinance Initiative (WMI) began issuing loans in 2008 and trains local women in managing loan hubs. WMI has loaned more than $4.5 million to rural women in amounts of $100 to $250 at an interest rate of 10 percent.

## Recommendations

The  lending domain has many riks.  Exploring and developing financial products across new markets is risky. There are many risks in the current Kiva's business model.
* Borrower risk
* Field Partner risk
* Direct loan risk
* Country risk
* Currency risk

KIVA current business model relies heavily on in country  field partners  to manage its loans and operations. To mitigate the risks associated with its  current business model;  I suggest a Hub and Spoke Business approach  where KIVA keeps its  headquarters in Francisco but operate from multiple regional offices or coworking spaces across the globe. The hub and spoke model refer to a distribution method in which a centralized "hub" exists, and  spokes are a geographically distributed network of offices across the globe. 

Globally, 1.7 billion adults are unbanked. There is always a need to provide  access  to capital in rural areas across the globe where traditional banking cannot through a Mobile phone money lending.  With access to cell phone on the remote areas in the developing countries,  Kiva can add  new initiative to give unbanked people digital identity and secure control over their own credit information
