Hasan founded BRAC in 1972 and it employs more than 120,000 people in 11 countries. BRAC has a microfinance program, primarily in Bangladesh, which has loaned to 5.6 million borrowers, 87 percent of whom are women. Unlike Kiva and Zidisha, which operate person-to-person lending services, BRAC distributes loans to lenders on its own using donations and other funds. BRAC also does work unrelated to microfinance, investing in schools and in water, hygiene and sanitation services.

WMI has loaned more than $4.5 million to rural women in amounts of $100 to $250 at an interest rate of 10 percent.

 Introducing Kiva Protocol, an exciting new initiative to give unbanked people digital identity and secure control over their own credit information.
Kiva, Sierra Leone and U.N. agencies announced the first implementation of the Kiva Protocol on Sept. 27, 2018, at the U.N. General Assembly. The Kiva Protocol will be used to create a nationwide digital identification system designed to help the country’s 7 million citizens access the financial services they need to improve their lives.

Globally, 1.7 billion adults are unbanked, including 80% of the citizens of Sierra Leone. Two of the major barriers to accessing financial services are a lack of formal identification and a lack of verifiable credit history.

The new Kiva Protocol is designed to address these barriers by using distributed ledger technology to issue digital identification to all citizens. Through the Kiva Protocol, both formal and informal financial institutions (from banks to shopkeepers giving credit) can help contribute to a person’s credit history.
